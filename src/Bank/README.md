Multithreading

Write a java application that maintains a bank account of customers. Several transactions, such as
deposit some amount to an account and withdraw some amount from an account etc. are possible.
Now, for a given account, if two or more transactions come simultaneously then only one transaction
should be allowed at a time instead of simultaneous transaction processing so that data inconsistency
will never occur.
